# Day 18 - Task 5 - Draw a Spirograph

In this task I learned how to use the "turtle" module to draw a spirograph pattern of 60 circles of radius 50 and random color, overlapping each other by starting drawing of each circle at an increasing length of arc on a larger circle of r:radius 100 until all circles have been drawn.

I created a function called;

```
draw_spirograph()
```

which draws the spirograph pattern in the "turtle" GUI screen by iterating through a for-loop 60 times, drawing a small circle of radius 50 in a random color and at the end, positioning the turtle on an ever-increasing length of arc on a larger circle of radius 100.

The program saves the image content of the turtle screen to a .png image file which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/sjlearmonth/100-Days-of-Code---The-Complete-Python-Pro-Bootcamp/blob/b19d4ff4f708cfb95bcaebe215175bf1ace0f502/Day-011...020/Day-018/Task-5/screen-files/Spirograph.png).
